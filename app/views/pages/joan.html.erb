		<p>Meet Jacinta and Joan. They live in Athi River in the outskirts of Nairobi with their mother.  They are young talented ladies who like many other Kenyan girls lacked the opportunity of getting formal employment.</p>

		<p>Seeing this art and talent as a way out, they decided to risk all of their little savings in buying the necessary material to start their own beading material.</p>
		 
		<p>They still face a lot of challenges since they lack skills necessary for running a business, and are sometimes taken advantage of, leading to huge losses. Jacinta and Joan are still holding on to their dream of opening their own curio shop to be able to take care of their mom and themselves.</p>

		<p>The Kubmo program will allow the girls to connect with mentors who will give them advice they can trust.  They will be able to research different types of jewelry to make, and therefore become more skilled workers. Once their shop is opened, they will also have access to business and organizational applications. </p>
